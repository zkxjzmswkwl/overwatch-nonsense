# This is ass.
Liquipedia hardcodes all their html structuring for each new game they choose to support. Unfortunately, this project was meant to support all available games on Liquipedia. However, I don't fucking care anymore and am not going to do that, because I shouldn't have to.

## Functionality
Provides a function that returns a dictionary with `to`, `from`, and `neutral` keys, each with a `list` value. The lists contain the following `key,value` pairs.

`{"name": "Yaki", "old": "Florida Mayhem", "new": "None"}`

These used to be piped into a Discord bot that sent messages to a channel whenever a player was dropped, traded, or retired. I lost `disc.py` file, if I find it I'll push it here.
