"Remove highlight intro/outro" button will remove the obnoxious 6 second intro and 14 second outro from your Overwatch highlight, then output the file to `file_name_output.mp4` in the same directory.

`start` and `end` are `hh:mm:ss` formatted. This is `hourhour:minuteminute:secondsecond`.

If you want your highlight to start at 5 seconds and end at 16 seconds, you would set them as follows:

Start -> `00:00:05`

End   -> `00:00:16`

Support for concatenation/joining of clips added Jan. 2022.
